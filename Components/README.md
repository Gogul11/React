Components :
    Components is a independent and reusable bits of code works similar to functions which is reusable.
    In the src folder the file 'App.jsx' is used to import the functional components.
    The functinal components contains a retrun statement within that you can write your HTML content and at the same
    time a return statement contains only one tag whereas you can use child tags (i.e) you can add more tags inside a 
    single div tag.(NOTE : The first letter of the component name should be capital letters because to distinguish between 
    HTML tags and the name)
    EXAMPLE : 

          function Hello(){
          
              return(
                    <h1>Welcome</h1>
                    );
                    
                    }
          export default Hello
